<h1>Do you know what your pet needs?</h1>
<p>Proper pet care is the basis of responsible pet ownership. It is important when you adopt a pet to understand it is a lifetime commitment to a furry family member that depends on you for his or her health and well-being. </p>
<p>Happily, the unconditional love and joy that pets bring to our lives more than makes up for the added responsibility that comes with welcoming adding a furry child to your family. To ensure your pet’s health and happiness, following are the necessities that all responsible pet owners need to provide.</p>

<h2>Pets need healthy food.</h2>
<p>Just like people, pets need food that meets their specific nutritional needs. Dog foods are designed to meet a dog’s nutritional needs and cat foods are designed to meet a cat’s nutritional needs. Importantly, their dietary needs are very different. Puppies require different food from senior dogs. Pet’s with health issues may require special diets. Table scraps are typically not good for dogs and cats because many of the foods we eat, such as salt, garlic, and onions are bad for your pet’s health and can make them sick or even be fatal.</p>

<h2>Give your pets 24/7 access to fresh drinking water.</h2>
<p>Just like human beings, pets need ready access to water in order to survive. Always provide a clean, fresh bowl of water to all animals in your care. Make it accessible by placing it near their food bowl, and remember to refill your pet’s water bowl at least two times a day. This will keep your pet cool, hydrated, and healthy. </p>
<p>If your pet lives in water, like fish and turtles, clean aquariums at least once a week. Failing to do so could lead to smelly tanks and sick pets!</p>

<h2>Proper pet care includes providing a safe, cozy shelter.</h2>
<p>Pets need protection from extreme hot and cold temperatures and other extreme weather and shouldn’t be expected to live exclusively outside. Another concern is predators like coyotes (who tend to lurk at night but are often present in the daytime as well) that might consider your pets as suitable prey. </p>

<h2>Pets need to go to the bathroom regularly.</h2>
<p>Many types of pets can be housebroken, allowing them the opportunity to roam the house without the worries of accidents. Cats should be provided at least one litter box. </p>
<p>No matter where your pet’s bathroom is, be sure to clean it regularly. Observing proper hygiene and sanitation will prevent dirt and bacteria from piling up and help protect your pet’s health. Your pets will greatly appreciate having a clean area to do their business, too!</p>

<h2>Make sure that your pet gets regular exercise. </h2>
<p>Proper pet care also includes exercising your pet. Exercise is an important part of your pet’s mental, as well as physical, health. If you spend any time on social media, you know that all kinds of animals like to play such as this ball-playing turtle, this dog playing fetch by himself or this bird playing with a red cup. What some people consider misbehavior in a pet is just the pet getting bored an amusing itself by getting in the garbage or tearing up the couch or…well you get the idea. </p>

<h2>Pets require doctor visits and healthy habits.</h2>
<p>To ensure that your pets are healthy and nimble, you should take them to a local, trusted veterinarian for wellness check-ups at least once a year. Keeping up on your pet’s vaccinations [LINK: Cat & Dog Vaccines] is essential. Clean teeth and healthy gums also play an important role in your pet’s health.  If your furry friend is showing signs or symptoms of being sick, take them to your vet or animal hospital right away to get them feeling better sooner rather than later!</p>
<p>Another way to keep your pets healthy and happy is to regularly groom them (if needed). Matted fur can be painful and unhealthy for dogs. Dogs and cats may not like it, but baths, brushings, nail trims, and flea/tick removal may be necessary for your pet’s well-being.</p>
