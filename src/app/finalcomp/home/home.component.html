        <h5>Your Pet's Medications</h5>
        <p>When your pet has a medical condition, your veterinarian might prescribe one or more medications intended to manage, treat or cure the problem. Although there are some veterinary-specific drugs, many of the drugs used in veterinary medicine are the same as those used in people.</p>

	<h1>Dogs</h1>
	<p>Dogs are domesticated mammals that are closely related to wolves. They are one of the most popular pets in the world, known for their loyalty, affection, and playful nature. There are hundreds of breeds of dogs, each with its own unique characteristics. Dogs are highly social animals and thrive on human interaction. They require regular exercise, a nutritious diet, and veterinary care.
    <br>
    <br>
    They also need to be trained and socialized from a young age to prevent behavioral problems. Dogs have a keen sense of smell and are often used in law enforcement, search and rescue, and hunting. They are also used for entertainment, such as in dog shows and competitions. It is important for owners to provide proper care and training to ensure a happy and healthy relationship between themselves and their canine companion.</p>

	<h1>Bird</h1>
	<p>Birds are a diverse group of animals that belong to the class Aves. There are over 10,000 species of birds, and they can be found in a wide variety of habitats, from tropical rainforests to polar regions. Birds are characterized by their feathers, which serve flight, insulation, and display. They also have a lightweight, streamlined body that is adapted for flight, a four-chambered heart, and a unique respiratory system. Birds play important ecological roles, such as pollination, seed dispersal, and insect control.
    <br>
    <br>
    Many bird species are also kept as pets, and are popular for their beauty, intelligence, and ability to mimic sounds and speech. However, many bird species are threatened by habitat loss, climate change, and other human activities. Conservation efforts are necessary to protect these important animals and their habitats.</p>

	<h1>Fish</h1>
	<p>Fish are aquatic animals that come in a wide range of shapes, sizes, and colors. They are cold-blooded, meaning their body temperature is regulated by the temperature of the water they live in. Fish play an important role in many ecosystems, serving as both predators and prey. They are a major source of food for many people, and are popular pets kept in aquariums. Some species of fish are also used for medical research, as their unique biological characteristics can provide insights into human health.
<br>
<br>
    There are many types of fish, ranging from tiny guppies to massive whale sharks. Some species of fish are also commercially important for their meat and eggs. Overall, fish are fascinating creatures that play an important role in the natural world and in human societies.</p>

<div class="content7">
	<h1>Reptiles</h1>
	<p>Reptiles are air-breathing, cold-blooded vertebrates that have scaly bodies rather than hair or feathers; most reptile species are egg-laying, though certain “squamates” — lizards, snakes and worm-lizards — give birth to live young. Most lizards are omnivores so need different types of food in their diet. Your lizard should be fed fruit or vegetables, and either crickets, snails or cockroaches. For more advice on feeding your lizard, ask one of our friendly Pets Domain Staff.
  <br>
  <br>
    Fresh water should always be provided for your reptile and will need to be changed at least twice a week.</p>
