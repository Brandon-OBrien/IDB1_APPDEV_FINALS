                                        <h1>Leucistic Axolotl</h1>
                                        <p>Although at first glance this is easy to mistake for the standard albino, the leucistic axolotl actually has more translucent see-through skin with red gill filaments and dark brown or black eyes.</p>
                                        <h1>Black Melanoid Axolotl</h1>
                                        <p>First discovered in 1961, the black melanoid is now among the most common axolotl color morphs in the world. The particular mixture of pigments in its skin produces a large range between dark green and completely black morphs with dark purple gills and a pale gray or purple belly as well.</p>
                                        <h1>Chimera Axolotl</h1>
                                        <p>Chimera axolotl morphs are very rare variations produced by an accident in development. Characterized by half-white and half-black skin color split right down the horizontal length of the body, the chimera is the result of two eggs (one wild type and one albino) morphing together before hatching. They are so rare and so unusual that they are not consistently sold by stores. Many of the eggs do not hatch because they fail to fuse properly.</p>
                                        <h1>White Albino Axolotl</h1>
                                        <p>The white albino axolotl is among the most common artificial color morphs. Characterized by a pure white body, red gill filaments, and pink or white eyes, the albino morph is the result of the axolotl producing much less of the pigment known as melanin, which not only determines skin color but also protects the skin from UV radiation. </p>
                                        <h1>Golden Albino Axolotl</h1>
                                        <p>The golden albino is actually the most common artificial axolotl color. It is characterized by bright gold skin (as well as white, pink, or yellow eyes and reflective patches covering the body) that subtly changes color from white to yellow to orange-gold over the course of its lifetime. </p>

                                <p>Also known as Pacman frogs these are a large ground-dwelling species that love to burrow into soil or moss. They are commonly sold in a variety of colour morphs like Albino, ‘Tri-color’ or ‘Fantasy’, aside from lighting for an albino the care is exactly the same across these variations. When fully grown this frog can grow to around 8 inches in length and are generally feisty but they can be held from behind once you get used to picking them up.</p>
                                <h1>Gray Tree Frogs (Hyla chrysoscelis)</h1>
                                <p>Gray tree frogs are small tree-dwelling frogs commonly found in North America and Canada. They are the smallest arboreal frog in this list and probably the quickest too. They are a little difficult to catch and handling can be stressful for the frog  so they aren’t the most interactive pet however, due to their size, they can be housed comfortably in a relatively small enclosure making them a great feature or decorative pet.</p>
                                <h1>Red eye tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas)</h1>
                                <p>Red eye tree frogs are the iconic tree frog. With bright green, yellow and blue bodies and vibrant red eyes these are spectacular pets. This species grows fairly large so we would have a 45x45x60 cm terrarium for 1-2 frogs. They need humidity, warmth and UVB and they can be quite sensitive but the reward is worth the work. Though they are slow through most of the day we see ours light up whenever it’s meal time or when they are sprayed. As with the other colourful frogs in this list, they look magnificent when paired with a live enclosure and jungle plants. </p>
                                <h1>Whites tree frogs (Litoria caerulea)</h1>
                                <p>The whites tree frog is the largest arboreal frog in this list. They are normally light blue or green with white underbellies and can get to 5 inches in length. They are quite a lazy frog so can be caught and handled with relative ease. This couples with their large size makes them one of the most easy to find and most handleable in the list. We sell more of these than most other arboreal frogs and they are out most popular amphibian in store for families. </p>

                                <p>They are ideal for beginners because they are easy to care for and have a distinctly non-aggressive nature. However, they contain tetrodotoxin, a potent neurotoxin, and it’s vital to wash hands and utensils thoroughly after coming into contact with these newts.</p>
                                <h1>Dunn’s Salamander</h1>
                                <p>They are small salamanders, reaching about 6 inches in adulthood, and typically have a gray-green base color with round black spots. Some salamanders will not have any spots, however, and they may also have an iridescent blue coloration over their entire bodies.</p>
                                <h1>Fire Salamander</h1>
                                <p>Fire Salamanders are a fairly complex species and subspecies, with at least six different varieties available. They are large amphibians, ranging between 6-12 inches in adulthood, and they typically have a brown or glossy black coloration with lighter spots.</p>
                                <h1>Marbled Salamander</h1>
                                <p>he medium-sized yet chunky Marbled Salamander reaches up to 5 inches in adulthood but is thick-set and bulky for its size. They are typically black with white bars running horizontally down their bodies and on their heads. These salamanders spend most of their time underground in burrows, leading to their nickname, “mole salamanders.”</p>
                                <h1>Tiger Salamander</h1>
                                <p>he Tiger Salamander is one of the most widespread and popular species kept as pets, mostly due to their beautiful, unique coloring and their easy-going nature. They are bold animals and are known to recognize their owners and may even beg for food! They can reach up to 13 inches in length in adulthood and can live up to 20 years in captivity.</p>

                <h1>Children’s Python</h1>
                <p>hildren’s Pythons grow between 2.5 and four feet making them rare medium-sized snakes that stay small. These pet pythons are great for beginners and are docile enough to be around supervised kids. The reptile requires the most basic care and diet on rodents.</p>
                <h1>Common Boa Constrictor</h1>
                <p>Due to their very large size, boas aren’t the best pet for the novice. At a titillating 13 to 16 feet in length, the boa constrictor needs an experienced handler. Found in South and Central America, the boa snacks on deer, lizards, fish, and other creatures</p>
                <h1>Western Hognose Snake</h1>
                <p>Native to the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, the Western Hognose Snake is known for its upturned pug-ish nose. Active in the mornings and evenings, the breeds snack on toads and small lizards, and mice (when toads and lizards aren’t available).</p>
                <h1>Garter Snake</h1>
                <p> Garters are among the world’s most populous wild snakes and popular home pets. Captive garters gnaw on worms and small fish. With common heating and lighting requirements, they don’t need a lot of maintenance. It’s good to set them up with a basking lamp as the garter enjoys resting in the sun. </p>
                <h1>Ball Python</h1>
                <p>The ball python is famous for its pickiness and its food. They prefer thawed or freshly killed meals, but there then are periods when they stop eating completely. But the nature of this pet python is calm and docile, and suspicious. You’re going to spend some time earning their trust. One characteristic of the snake is curling into a ball when intimidated. </p>
                <h1>California King Snake</h1>
                <p>The Cali King Snake is usually brown-black with yellow stripes, bands, or speckles. An excellent beginner snake, the Cali King is a shy, docile animal with frequent handling. When stressed, the snake doesn’t lash out. </p>

                                <p>These turtles are generally housed indoors, but with the right shelter, cleaning, and warmer temperatures, they can also do well in an outdoor pond. As they mature, it can be easier to provide them with the space they need outside.</p>
                                <h1>African Sideneck Turtle</h1>
                                <p>These unique little aquatic turtles have distinctive long necks that can't be retracted fully into their shell, and their anatomy differs from traditional water-based turtles.
                                  Because of their unique appearance and size, they're often a popular choice, but they have more complex care requirements than some other turtles.</p>
                                <h1>Eastern Box Turtle</h1>
                                <p>They prefer a humid environment, need a shallow pool of water in their enclosure, a moist substrate, and they will need a UVB basking light if they're kept indoors.</p>
                                <h1>Western Painted Turtle</h1>
                                <p>Although they aren't big, these aquatic turtles need a large tank or outdoor space, a good water filtration system and basking lights to help maintain a warm temperature. Their housing needs are similar to that of the red-eared slider.</p>
                                <h1>Mississippi Map Turtle</h1>
                                <p>They don't need quite as big enclosures as some of their aquatic turtle relatives, and this can make them an appealing choice for those with space limitations.</p>
                                <h1>Spotted Turtle</h1>
                                <p>If you have limited space and are looking for an aquatic turtle, the spotted turtle is one of the smallest species allowed to be kept in captivity. They're also pretty to look at with their distinctive spotted shell and, with the right housing, they can live indoors or out.</p>

                <h1>Finch</h1>
                <p>Finches are ideal for people who want to enjoy watching birds but prefer not to handle them. They are somewhat skittish, appreciating the companionship of other finches over humans. </p> 
                <h1>Canary</h1>
                <p>Native to the Macronesian islands, canaries are known for their bright plumage and beautiful songs. Like other members of the finch family, these small birds don't tolerate handling well. But with ample training, a canary might learn to perch on a person. House a canary in a roomy flight cage, especially if you don't have another safe space for it to fly. Additionally, it's often necessary to house canaries individually, as they can be territorial.</p>
                <h1>Budgerigar</h1>
                <p>Budgerigars, also known as budgies or parakeets, are small birds with big personalities. As one of the smallest parrots, budgies come in an array of colors, and they can learn to talk. These smart birds require lots of toys and socialization to keep them happy. If you can't spend enough time with your budgie, consider getting at least two to prevent loneliness.</p>
                <h1>Parrotlet</h1>
                <p>Parrotlets, also called "pocket parrots," don't seem to realize how small they are. Like their cousin, the huge-by-comparison Amazon parrot, parrotlets tend to have bold, comical personalities and crave attention. </p>
                <h1>Bourke's Parakeet</h1>
                <p>Bourke’s parakeets are generally mellow birds. These Australia natives often bond closely with their humans and do well with other peaceful birds, such as finches. But their gentle nature can make them a target of more aggressive birds. They're only moderately active but still require at least a few hours of exercise outside the cage each day.</p>
                <h1>Lovebird</h1>
                <p>True to their name, lovebirds thrive in bonded pairs. But a single bird also can do well with an involved caretaker. Lovebirds don't like to be alone ​and can develop behavioral issues, such as biting, with neglect.</p>
                <h1>Green-Cheeked Conure</h1>
                <p>Green-cheeked conures have become popular for their playful, affectionate disposition, but they do require adequate handling to avoid behavioral issues. These South America natives tend to be fast learners with tricks and games (though most usually don't talk). However, they are prone to feather picking if they’re bored or neglected.</p>
                <h1>Cockatiel</h1>
                <p>Native to Australia, cockatiels are valued for their friendly personalities. When properly socialized, they tend to be docile birds that love people. They’re generally not noisy, though they can learn to be excellent whistlers. A single cockatiel is fine, as long as you give it lots of attention. Otherwise, a pair of birds can keep each other company.</p>

                <h1>Eclectus</h1>
                <p>Eclectus parrots are a dimorphic species, meaning the male and female birds sport different feather colors. The male eclectus is a bright green with red and blue accents while the female eclectus is a brilliant red with a blue-purple belly. </p>
                <h1>Sulphur-Crested Cockatoo</h1>
                <p>The sulphur-crested cockatoo is one of the largest cockatoo species. And with proper care, it can live up to 80 years in captivity. An aviary environment is best for these large birds, offering them room to climb and fly.</p>
                <h1>Double Yellow-Headed Amazon</h1>
                <p>The double yellow-headed Amazon is one of the most popular Amazon species, living around 60 years in captivity. These birds are highly intelligent and have a remarkable mimicry ability. Some can even mimic opera singing. They generally love attention and can be rather noisy, especially if they’re bored or feel ignored.</p>
                <h1>Scarlet Macaw</h1>
                <p>Scarlet macaws can be a commitment of 80 years or more, though a 40- to 50-year lifespan is more typical. They are very intelligent and energetic birds, requiring ample mental and physical exercise. An aviary environment or several hours out of the cage each day is recommended for these large birds to burn off their energy.</p>
                <h1>Blue-And-Gold Macaw</h1>
                <p>Blue-and-gold macaws can live around 60 years, and they need a dedicated caretaker who can meet their needs for entertainment and socialization. They tend to be friendly birds and enjoy being near their favorite people as much as possible. As large birds, they are capable of incredibly loud vocalizations, so they’re not ideal for people who can’t handle a noisy environment.</p>
                <h1>Red-And-Green Macaw</h1>
                <p>The red-and-green macaw, also called the green-winged macaw, is one of the largest pet bird species, living around 50 years in captivity. It ideally should be housed in an aviary environment where it can move freely. But potential caretakers should be warned these birds are often voracious chewers, and their powerful beaks can cause serious damage to a home if they don’t have their own chew toys.</p>
                <h1>Umbrella Cockatoo</h1>
                <p>Umbrella cockatoos tend to be gentle companions and live to about 70 to 80 years. And they’re some of the most affectionate birds you can find. Many love to cuddle with their favorite humans (or other birds), and they require lots of attention every day to keep them from feeling neglected. They also don’t tend to do well in a confined space and need as large of an enclosure as possible.</p>
                <h1>Hyacinth Macaw</h1>
                <p>Hyacinth macaws are the largest of all parrots. And they require an experienced caretaker who has the time and resources to meet their complex care needs for their 60-year lifespan. Few cages can even contain this large bird, and an aviary is better for it to be able to move comfortably. Despite their imposing size, these birds tend to be gentle and can bond strongly with their caretakers.</p>

                <h1>Here are some common dog breeds </h1>
                <h1>French Bulldog</h1>
                <p>With a wrinkled face, large bat ears, and irresistible puppy eyes, it's easy to see why this photogenic breed is such a popular choice. Small in size and relatively quiet, they're a natural choice for city dwellers. Choose a leash or a backpack to tote your Frenchy around.</p>
                <h1>Labrador Retriever</h1>
                <p>These notoriously friendly dogs are the definition of man's best friend. Originally bred to retrieve ducks, the sporty breed is known for its endless affection and general enthusiasm for life. You can easily identify this dog's passion if you initiate a game of fetch.</p>
                <h1>Golden Retriever</h1>
                <p>Extroverted and easygoing, it's hard to picture a golden retriever that's not wagging its tail. Highly trainable and the definition of man's best friend, golden retrievers are equally compatible for work or play. Just be sure you are ready for some serious hair shedding. </p>
                <h1>German Shepherd Dog</h1>
                <p>Hard-working, loyal, and courageous, German shepherds are best known for their role as working members of society. At home, the breed is a gentle guardian.</p>
                <h1>Poodle</h1>
                <p>With a variety of sizes and colors, there's a poodle for everyone out there. Poodles have a reputation for being high-maintenance and sassy, but really they are skilled athletes and smart creatures who make for loving, trainable family companions.</p>
                <h1>Bulldog</h1>
                <p>Thanks to a hearty build and gentle nature, this one-of-a-kind breed makes for loving and loyal companions. They are sensitive to their environments and can get overheated easily, but that's easy to overcome if you are already a huge fan of air conditioning.</p>
                <h1>Beagle</h1>
                <p>This popular breed boasts a permanently puppy-like appearance, which, coupled with its curious nature and playful personality makes it a natural winner when it comes to popularity. Beagles are known for their barking and howling, a reaction that was bred into this pooch due to its role in hunting.</p>
                <h1>Rottweiler</h1>
                <p>Properly trained "rotties" are cool, calm, and collected. This may make them seem aloof to outsiders, but family members know what a cuddly teddy bear this breed can be. Certainly, they might have a bit of a guard dog reputation, but ultimately this dog is a lover not a fighter.</p>
                <h1>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</h1>
                <p>The corgi surprised experts by making the top 10 list just recently in 2019. Their absolutely adorable looks and clever nature contribute to their popularity of course, but Brandi Hunter, the AKC's vice president of public relations and communications, suggested pop culture may have contributed to their rise as well.</p>
                <h1>Dachshund</h1>
                <p>The dachshund's distinct look has earned it quite the fandom, but its wonderful personality shouldn't be overlooked either. Bold, sometimes stubborn, and always enthusiastic, this popular breed is endlessly endearing. These little doggos will do their best to protect the ones they love, and their bark is much larger than their size.</p>
                <h1>Yorkshire Terrier</h1>
                <p>Don't be fooled by the glamorous coat on these petite beauty queens. The "Yorkie" was originally bred as a hard-working ratter and still boasts many of those tenacious terrier qualities today. On the other hand, this little fella would be so happy to be a permanent lapdog.</p>
                <h1>Australian Shepherd</h1>
                <p>If you've ever met an Australian shepherd, you know just how smart they can be. (And fun!) Tireless and tough, this breed is the cowboy's best friend. These dogs are loyal, and are always looking for someone to herd, whether it be humans or livestock.</p>
                <h1>Boxer</h1>
                <p>Boxers have it all: This popular breed is loyal and courageous but also goofy and affectionate, making them the life of the party. They are known to be springy and very attached to their humans. You will need a good strategy to ensure this dog is getting all the exercise it needs.</p>
                <h1>Siberian Husky</h1>
                <p>Not to be confused with Alaskan malamutes (or wolves), these hard-working dogs were built for long-distance running and harsh, cold climates. Their most striking feature has got to be their steel blue eyes, which they will fix on you with some intensity if dinner is late.</p>

                </div>
                <h1>Domestic Shorthair</h1>
                <p>Not to be confused with the American Shorthair, the Domestic Shorthair is often considered to be the “mutt” of cat breeds due to their mixed and unknown heritages. Because of this, Domestic Shorthairs can present a variety of physical attributes, but they are generally medium sized with round faces, sleek and soft short coats, and can be any mix of colors.</p>
                <h1>American Shorthair</h1>
                <p>hough American Shorthair cats would love to snuggle up on a couch with you, they’re also known as working cats: hearty, muscular, and alert. They typically adapt well to humans and animals alike and are generally well-rounded in temperament. </p>
                <h1>Domestic Longhair</h1>
                <p>Like Domestic Shorthair cats, Domestic Longhair cats are simply cats that have long hair and are of unknown ancestry. They’re especially common for this reason—most cats aren’t purebreds! Also like their shorthaired friends, they were brought to North America from Europe via ships.</p>
                <h1>Maine Coon</h1>
                <p>Maine Coons have relatively large bodies and sport lush, heavy coats. They’re muscular, sturdy, and simultaneously regal in stature. Their large eyes, significant paws, and high cheekbones distinguish them from other cat breeds.</p>
                <h1>Siamese</h1>
                <p>Perhaps one of the most distinctive breeds, Siamese cats are most often cream colored, with grey-brown paws and icy blue eyes. Everything about Siamese is a bit pointier than other breeds, from the large, triangular ears to their delicate paws. They’ll often have the same grey-brown coloring on their ears and face. Siamese cats are now bred to come in different colors and patterns. </p>
                <h1>Russian Blue</h1>
                <p>Russian Blue cats have short, soft coats in variations of dark grey and silver. They might show faint stripes but are otherwise patternless. Russian Blues have double coats, adding a plush look to their otherwise more delicate frames. They often have yellow-green eyes and a distinct “smile” on their face.</p>
                <h1>Ragdoll</h1>
                <p>Large and fluffy, Ragdoll cats are a pointed breed. Cats of pointed breeds have lighter-colored bodies with a darker face, legs, tail, and ears. While their coloring can vary slightly, their blue eyes are distinctive.</p>
                <h1>Bengal</h1>
                <p>A Bengal’s marbled coat is their most distinctive feature, but it’s also impossibly soft and possesses a muscular physique. Though all cats within the breed have different personalities, Bengals are generally active and playful in a kitten-like way, even at an older age. They need pet parents who are willing to keep them busy and entertained, and who are tolerant of a cat who may need a more stimulating, enriched home to thrive.</p>
                <h1>Bombay</h1>
                <p>Bombay cats are strikingly panther-like in appearance. They were initially bred in the 1950s by crossing a domestic shorthair with a Burmese cat. American breeders wanted to breed a cat that would take on the body type of a Burmese, but with a black coat and copper eyes. Eventually the The Cat Fanciers’ Association recognized the new breed in the 1970s, and while it’s not the most common breed, it continues to have a loyal following.</p>
                <h1>Persian</h1>
                <p>Persian cats have stocky bodies with flat, slightly scrunched looking faces. This is one of the qualities people are often so drawn to, but it can lead to the need for additional medical care. They sport long, soft coats that range in a variety of colors, including white and black. Though they share some physical characteristics with Maine Coons, they’re often smaller and range between 7-12 pounds.</p>

                <h1>Albino</h1>
                <p>Albino ferrets have a white coat, a pink nose, and pink to red eyes. They mainly look attractive because of their neat white coat, which also makes it easier for the owners to locate their pets even in dark rooms. These ferrets are especially energetic in the morning and love to nap in the afternoons. They should be bathed once a month. Albino ferrets are often kept as a therapy pet for the kids and the elderly.</p>
                <h1>Black Sable</h1>
                <p>Black sable ferrets are coloured deep black from their nose to the tail tip. Their head also has a hood-like mark that reaches their nose. Their undercoat is of a white or creamy shade. The Black Sables’ guard hairs are dark ash blackish brown without any warm tone. Their eyes are near black or dark brown, while their nose is also ash blackish brown.</p>
                <h1>Black Sable Mitt</h1>
                <p>Black sable mitt ferrets have almost the same colours as the black sable, but with four white feet from the toe tip to around two-thirds of their legs. Their guard hairs should be genuinely black with zero to little white guard hairs. Aside from their mitts, they also have a white bib. Their eye colour is black or nearly black, just as it is with their nose.</p>
                <h1>Blaze</h1>
                <p>Blaze ferrets have a coat with varied colours. They have a distinct unbroken white stripe from the face to the area between their eyes, over their head and the area down the back of your neck. They also have a white bib and four mitts. These ferrets also have minor colour rings surrounding their eyes. Some blaze ferrets have small masks.</p>
                <h1>Champagne</h1>
                <p>Champagne ferrets have warm milk chocolate brown guard hairs. Their undercoat is white, as preferred by standards, although ferrets with a slight golden hue are also accepted. Their eyes are pink, beige, or pink with a light brown or beige ‘T’ outline.</p>
                <h1>Heavy Silver or Pewter</h1>
                <p>Heavy silver ferrets have a deep, gunmetal grey coat with black hairs. They have a black, mottled or pink nose. Their mitts are a taken and their mask seems like a blotch under the eyes.</p>
                <h1>Panda</h1>
                <p>Panda ferrets have a white head, with the white hairs covering the nose to the shoulder area. They have a white bib that covers the entire underside portion of the ferret’s body. Their coloured part of the body has a saddle shape. Pandas are also noted for their pink nose, mitts, white-tipped tail, and eyes that are of any colour.</p>
                <h1>Siamese</h1>
                <p>Siamese ferrets are just standard sable, cinnamon or chocolate ferrets with darker shades on their legs and feet. They have a V-shaped mask that is as dark as the colour of their extremities and tail. Their underside is marked with a dark line that has the same colour as the hairs on their legs, feet, and tail.</p>
                <h1>Striped White</h1>
                <p>Striped white ferrets mostly have a white coat with a dark line running down their back, particularly tracing their backbone. There are ferrets though with a stripe that reaches their tail. Their nose is either black or pink. Their eyes are dark ruby or pink.</p>
                <h1>White with Dark Eyes</h1>
                <p>Dark-eyed or black-eyed white ferrets have a white coat, but some of these ferrets have a few dark hairs covering their backbone area. They have a black or pink nose and black eyes.</p>

                <h1>Holland Lop</h1>
                <p>he Holland Lop, developed in the Netherlands as a smaller version of the French Lop, sports cute floppy ears that frame their large head. Add a friendly personality to the mix, and you’ve got a breed that’s a sure winner! It’s easy to see why this breed, which comes in more than 30 colors, is one of the most popular around the world.</p>
                <h1>Mini Lop</h1>
                <p>Though a relatively small breed, the Mini Lop is actually larger than the Holland Lop. With their stocky body, softball-sized head, and delightful lopped ears, there’s nothing small about the appeal of this breed. The Mini Lop is as cuddly and as affectionate as they look, making them a joy to have around the house.</p>

                <p>Easily recognizable by their distinctive markings, the Dutch rabbit looks like they’re wearing a white shirt and dark pants. Despite their name, this popular breed was actually developed in England during the 1830s. Gentle and easygoing, the Dutch makes a wonderful addition to the family for both first-time and experienced rabbit parents.</p>
                <h1>Lionhead</h1>
                <p>With a magnificent mane around their head, the Lionhead rabbit is definitely hard to miss despite their small size. The Lionhead only became an officially recognized breed in the US in 2014, but their popularity has grown steadily thanks to their eye-catching looks and lovable personality. Though energetic and playful, this breed will also accompany you while you’re watching TV or reading a book.</p>
                <h1>French Lop</h1>
                <p>First introduced to the US in 1971, the French Lop is a large rabbit breed with long ears, chubby cheeks, and a wide forehead. This heavy-boned breed typically weighs 5-6 kg at adulthood, but don’t be intimidated by their massive size—the French Lop is known for being a calm and good-natured breed.</p>
                <h1>Californian</h1>
                <p>If you’re looking for a breed that loves to play, then the Californian is a furrific choice. Though they may seem shy at first, this breed is a “people rabbit” whose personality will shine with proper socialization. Almost completely white except for black markings on the nose, ears, feet, and tail, the Californian enjoys both playtime and cuddle time.</p>
                <h1>Dwarf Papillon</h1>
                <p>“Papillon” means butterfly in French, and you’ll know a Dwarf Papillon when you see one thanks to the butterfly marking on their nose. The Dwarf Papillon also has ears that adorably stick up in the shape of a V and a spine marking that runs along their back. For a leporine companion that’s strikingly cute, you can’t go wrong with this breed!</p>

                <h1>Syrian Hamster</h1>
                <p>Also known as golden or teddy bear hamsters, Syrian hamsters live around two to three years. They are typically solitary animals that need their own housing. Hamsters handled from a young age usually have an agreeable temperament. But they are nocturnal and can be grumpy if woken during the day.</p>
                <h1>Dwarf Hamster</h1>
                <p>Some dwarf hamsters can be social with other hamsters of their own species and can be housed in same-sex pairs or small groups. They can live up to three years. Although dwarf hamsters have a reputation for being a little nippy, most are easy to handle with a gentle touch.</p>
                <h1>Chinese Hamster</h1>
                <p>Although they aren't true dwarf hamsters, Chinese hamsters still are quite small. They're less common pets than other hamster varieties. Because they're so small and quick, they might be a challenge for some people to handle. They require a cage with bars they cannot squeeze through (or a glass aquarium).</p>
                <h1>Mongolian Gerbil</h1>
                <p>Gerbils are very active and social animals, and they are happy in a same-sex pair or small group. It is best to acquire them when they are young for easier bonding. With regular handling, gerbils can become quite tame. But their high energy level can make them difficult to hold.</p>
                <h1>Fancy Mouse</h1>
                <p>Although they're quick and skittish, mice can become quite tame if handled regularly. Many learn to take food from their caretaker's hand. They live one to three years on average. As social animals, females often do well in same-sex pairs or small groups, but males tend to fight other males.</p>
                <h1>Common Rat</h1>
                <p>Rats live an average of two to four years. They are very social, so it's best to keep a same-sex pair. With regular handling, they can become very tame and enjoy human companionship. They need out-of-cage time for social interaction and exercise and can even be taught some simple tricks.</p>
                <h1>Guinea Pig</h1>
                <p>Guinea pigs have an average lifespan of five to seven years. They're typically easy to handle and rarely bite, even when stressed. As social animals, they do well when kept in same-sex pairs. They have somewhat demanding diets, requiring fresh hay and veggies, as well as adequate amounts of vitamin C.</p>
                <h1>Chinchilla</h1>
                <p>Similar to rabbits in appearance, chinchillas are active and playful animals. They are largely nocturnal and prefer a quiet spot during the day. They don’t tend to like being held, as they would rather be moving and exploring. But many still can learn to enjoy the company of their caretakers. </p>
                <h1>African Dormouse</h1>
                <p>The African dormouse is a tiny, squirrel-like rodent that’s highly entertaining to watch. But because they are so quick and agile, they need a very secure habitat to prevent them from escaping. They require a roomy enclosure, such as a 20-gallon tank, with ropes and other items they can climb.</p>
                <h1>Common Degu</h1>
                <p>Native to Chile, degus are quite social animals that live in communities of up to 100 in the wild. They do well housed in same-sex pairs or small groups in captivity. These rodents are easily tamed when handled from a young age, and some even enjoy cuddling with their caretakers. </p>

                <h1>Orb Weaver</h1>
                <p>Orb Weavers are rare as they are not usually sold in pet stores or online. But, they make a great beginner spider for anyone that can find one.

                    This species is usually caught in gardens, fields and forests. Unlike pet lizards, many types of spiders can be caught in backyards and tend to be healthy when they live in tanks.</p>
                <h1>Black Widow</h1>
                <p>Black widows are famous for their terrifying black bodies and red hourglass markings. It is common to find one sitting in the middle of its silky web in southern and western states.</p>
                <h1>Huntsman Spider</h1>
                <p>Huntsman spiders come in mini (pictured above) and giant sizes. Mini Huntsmen are much more common pet spiders as giant species are too big to be kept as a pet. In fact, the Giant Huntsman is the world’s largest spider by leg span and can measure over 12 inches.</p>
                <h1>Costa Rican Zebra Tarantula</h1>
                <p>This species is also known as the Costa Rican Stripe-Knee Tarantula because of its unique appearance. It has the same bristly body as other tarantulas, but it has two white stripes on its knees. These stripes help it to blend in with Costa Rican forest and grasslands.</p>
                <h1>Fishing Spider</h1>
                <p>Unlike many pet spiders on our list, Fishing Spiders are quite unique. They can dive and swim under the water, as well as glide on the surface. They live near bodies of fresh water and eat insects, small fish, tadpoles, toads, and even baby salamanders.

                </p>
                <h1>Green Lynx</h1>
                <p>The Green Lynx is not a popular pet spider, but it is hardy and lives very well in a tank.

                    In North America the Green Lynx is usually found on leafy green plants which contributes to their green color. Females have been observed to gradually change color over the course of a couple of weeks if they are placed on a different colored background.</p>
                <h1>Curlyhair Tarantula</h1>
                <p>The Curlyhair Tarantula is one of the best pet spiders. It is widely bred in captivity and is of the most popular species in pet stores. Like the Zebra Tarantula (#9) they are also found in Costa Rica.</p>
                <h1>Crab Spider</h1>
                <p>There are thousands of species of Crab spiders. They are very common and can be found anywhere in the world, except for Greenland and Antarctica. You can even likely catch one in your backyard!</p>
                <h1>Pink-Toed Tarantula</h1>
                <p>The Pink-Toed Tarantula is a very friendly species that is great for first time spider keepers. They are very docile when handled gently and infrequently.

                    This pet tarantulas is a tree-dwelling spider found throughout South America.
                    
                    Pink toes are famous for their orange-pink-tipped “feet” that give them their signature name. The rest of their body is typically tarantula with furry dark brown hair</p>
                <h1>Chilean Rose Spider</h1>
                <p>The Chilean Rose is another species of tarantula that can make a great pet.

                    This spider has all the aspects of what makes the best pet spider. They are docile, easy to care for, slow-growing, live for a long time and are easy to find in pet stores.

                <h1>Emperor Scorpion</h1>
                <p>For beginners, the most universally recommended scorpion species to keep as a pet is the emperor scorpion. This scorpion is fairly docile, and the venom of its sting only causes a mild, localized reaction in most people. Some say this scorpion is more likely to try to pinch you with its claws than sting you, but it typically won't become aggressive unless it feels threatened.</p>
                <h1>Tanzanian Red-Clawed Scorpion</h1>
                <p>The Tanzanian red-clawed scorpion is from the same genus as the emperor scorpion, though it is smaller than its popular cousin. It also tends to be more aggressive and willing to sting than the emperor scorpion, so it is not recommended for beginners. But its venom is mild like a bee sting. Red claws can live for around eight years in captivity.</p>
                <h1>Malaysian Black Scorpion</h1>
                <p>The Malaysian black scorpion is a large, rainforest-dwelling species that is harder to find as a pet than the emperor scorpion. It also is more aggressive than the emperor scorpion and not ideal for beginners. It's prone to using its claws rather than stinging for protection. Its venom is mild, just causing localized pain and inflammation in most cases, which is why people still choose to keep it as a pet.</p>
                <h1>Javanese Jungle Scorpion </h1>
                <p>Native to the rainforests of Indonesia, the Javanese jungle scorpion can live for five to eight years in captivity. But it is fairly aggressive and territorial. These scorpions are most likely to protect themselves with their strong claws, and they also feature a stinger with mild venom. Unlike many other scorpion species, they can be kept in groups, though some might end up fighting.</p>
                <h1>Desert Hairy Scorpion </h1>
                <p>Desert hairy scorpions are found in the southwestern United States. As pets, they tend to be skittish but will assume a defensive posture if provoked. Their venom is more potent than that of the emperor scorpion, making a sting quite painful, so they are not recommended for beginners. These scorpions require a desert setup to their housing that includes a layer of coarse sand, as well as a rare misting.</p>
                <h1>Large-Clawed Scorpion</h1>
                <p>Large-clawed scorpions prefer to use their powerful claws for defense, and they rarely sting. For most people, their venom is mildly painful but not dangerous. Native to Northern Africa and the Middle East, these scorpions are found in deep burrows in wild deserts. That environment is somewhat difficult to reproduce in captivity, as one must have the appropriate soil depth and moisture content.</p>
                <h1>Dictator Scorpion</h1>
                <p>The dictator scorpion is closely related to the emperor scorpion. It has an impressively large body and powerful pincers. But it’s typically more timid than aggressive around people and will spend much of its time hiding in a burrow. Unlike many scorpions that must be housed individually, the dictator scorpion can coexist with other members of its species, except multiple males might fight.</p>
                <h1>Asian Forest Scorpion</h1>
                <p>The Asian forest scorpion looks very similar to the emperor scorpion, though it’s slightly smaller. It can be somewhat aggressive and territorial, and its sting is comparable to that of a hornet. But it’s more likely to defend itself with its claws. This species is fairly hardy and can live up to eight years in captivity.</p>
